Multilingual Phraseological Dictonary "IdeoPhrase 2.0"

The dictionary is meant to find phraseological units related to an idea indicated in a specific descriptor. The descriptors are choosable in dropout lists.
Though the first version of the dictionary works with a rule-based approach, the current version is built on the basis of artificial intelligence tools, particularly, such classifiers as kmeans and hierarchical clustering with scipy.
